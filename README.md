UI Evaluation 

## Lachlan
Bigger capital text to help with users who may be visually impaired
Lack of bright colours, consistent use of the same colours helps the app flow and easier to navigate, ties into aesthetic and minimal design
Recognition rather than recall when using consistent and familiar logos
Accessibility options such as highlighted text, text to speech and capital lettering helps visually and hearing impaired users
Booking confirmation for system status

## Denis
Minimalistic design helps with flow and understanding with making things too complex or overwhelming for the user
User control and freedom by having back buttons and home buttons to help navigation and allowing users to freely use the app
Consistent buttons and logos that all fit industry standard
Visibility of system status by showing a user that they have registered cars, bookings and created an account
Matching between system and real world by using common words and phrases that should be easily understood by the user
Main Focus on Denis' app as it seemed the more professional and effective between the two
